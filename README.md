# Magisk module of aria2c [upstream binary version 1.34.0](https://github.com/aria2/aria2/releases/tag/release-1.34.0) for android

aria2c is a utility for downloading files. The supported protocols are HTTP(S), FTP, SFTP, BitTorrent, and Metalink. aria2c can download a file from multiple sources/protocols and tries to utilize your maximum download bandwidth. It supports downloading a file from HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP and BitTorrent at the same time, while the data downloaded from HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP is uploaded to the BitTorrent swarm. Using Metalink's chunk checksums, aria2c automatically validates chunks of data while downloading a file like BitTorrent. The project page is located at [https://aria2c.github.io/].
